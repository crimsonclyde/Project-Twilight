## Exordium
An [Ouija Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouija "Wikipedia Ouija") is a connection to ghosts, to lost loved and, of course to the ancient great old once. The board has the alphabet and numbers written on it as well as yes, no and goodbye.
Sometimes hello, too.
With the use of a planchette you are maybe able to get in touch with those spirits. This event is called a sêance. The board acts as a medium that lets you get a glimpse behind the curtain.
The twilight zone! If the ghosts are pleased, contact is established and you can ask questions.

You can think about whatever you want, but the basic idea is a cool thing and the design is great.
The project started like many projects. You start thinking to repair an old table that suffered away through wind and weather and a moment later you end up with the idea of creating something awesome.

There are fantastic other ways to create an Ouija Board. A fantastic one and more or less a starter for this project is [Ouija Coffee Table](https://www.instructables.com/id/Ouija-Coffee-Table/ "Instructables: Ouija Coffee Table"). This idea is fantastic and I recommend you to check this out, too.

Free your mind and let the creativity flow. There are plenty of ways out there to improve this project or do it different.
One important point is, this project includes 3D print cause the board should have a more 3D effect. I provide all STL files. You can print 'em on your own 3D printer or you can ask someone with one. Another way could be to use a cutting plotter but the nice 3D effect is lost.
Hope is lost? No! Explore and learn, do something new. Even if it is currently in the twilight.




## Twilight?
According to Wikipedia: [Twilight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twilight "Wikipedia Twilight") *on Earth is the illumination of the lower atmosphere when the Sun itself is not directly visible because it is below the horizon. Twilight is produced by sunlight scattering in the upper atmosphere, illuminating the lower atmosphere so that Earth's surface is neither completely lit nor completely dark.*
Furthermore, every project need a name thus Project Ouija Board is somehow lame the decision was made to call it Project:Twilight.
How are we to judge decisions, eh?

Come, join the journey and enter the twilight zone!

## Signs

* The Sun was inspired by the design of the Stargate from the motion picture Stargate from 1994.
* The Moon follows the idea of a fractal design, more or less.
* The Elder Sign is a 3D creation of [August Derleth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Derleth "Wikipedia: August Derleth")
Elder Sign version from [H.P. Lovecraft's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft "Wikipedia: H.P. Lovecraft") magnificent [Cthulhu Mythos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu_Mythos "Wikipedia: Cthulhu Mythos").

## Disclaimer, protection & security notes (must read!)
If you do not agree with the rules stop any actions. The author is not responsible for anything you do.
Protect yourself! Think what might go wrong and how to secure you, people around you and the environment. This is important! The author does not take responsibility if something goes wrong, you hurt yourself or you slip into twilight.
Liability is excluded

This article stands as a muse to kick off your own creativity universe.
Use protective gear like glasses, gloves and masks wherever needed.
If you use a bunsen burner take extra care! This thing is hot, it is fire and fire can hurt you or you can set something on fire. Everything of this from hurting to set fire is not tolerable! Even the resin can start to burn have always a fire extinguisher near by!

I advice you strongly to read the instructions provided within your resin and hardener!
While the resin hardens it can get quit hot. Don't cast and let it dry indoors cause of acrid fumes.

**!! Think before you act !!**

## Lessons learned

* Glue
Standard craft glue is not enough. The resin releases the adhesive fixation. Maybe try superglue instead of standard glue.
* Casting
We cast a basic layer of resin and did another one after the first layer reaches a jelly state. This worked out nicely no layers visible.
* Bubble Theorem
We fixed bubbles in the beginning with a Crème brûlée bunsen burner. But we have to admit a few things here...
... be careful since a this bunsen burner reaches high temperature you seal the surface quick and later air enclosures cannot reach the surface. Means at a certain stage you cannot get rid of those bubbles.
... maybe try a hot air gun instead of a bunsen burner
... the resin can get on fire if you put to much heat on it, please be super careful!
... if you apply to much heat the surface may get yellow cause you burned it so be carful not to apply to much heat!
... do tests before! Do not start with such a big surface!
* Glitter
We put some glitter into the resin, works pretty well. You just need to know that 90 percent sinks down bottom.
* Resin ratio
Double, triple check the ratio between the resin and the hardener. Otherwise it will not dry and you loose all your work.
* Resin temperature
To dry the resin needs temps beyond 20° Celsius and under 80% humidity.
* Autodesk Fusion360 Fonts
Fusion360 can handle *only* TTFs (True Type Fonts) on Microsoft Windows Systems. It displays all fonts imported already to your Windows OS. OTFs (Open Type Fonts) are not visible in the dropdown in Fusion360. But there are converters out in the internet where you can convert OTF to TTF. Not all work fine, but trust me it works.


## Software
* Autodesk Fusion360
* Ultimaker Cura Version 4.5
* Font Hill House
This project uses the great font [Hill House](https://hicksdesign.co.uk/goodies "HICKS Design").
According to the author: *it is free to use in every way, including embedding on websites with @font-face"*

## Hardware

* Protective Gear
FFP3 mask, Gloves, Glasses
* 3D Printer Creality Ender-3 Pro
* Wood stain
Used a dark brownish environmental friendly wood stain from a hardware store
* Wood lacquer
Used chalk paint, color "Pearl". It turned out more white than "pearl".
* Grinding machine
* Filament
* Filament: Sunlu PLA transparent red
* Filament: Sunlu PLA+ black

## Instructions
A word about "instructions" it is up to you and this is the way this project was done.
Again, be creative and think, thinking is sexy so put your mind to the stars.
Read the "Lessons Learned" section again!

| Steps | Description|
| -------------|-------------|
| `Wood` | Get yourself some wood, think about size and if you want a disk shape or more square style, it is completely up to you |
| `Wood stain` | Just by some wood stain and apply it to the wood. Since we wanted to secure the wood and have a shabby chick look in the end we applied it to both sides of the wood.  |
| `Prepare for painting` | We need to get rid of some layers of the stain. Just to be sure that the next paint lasts on the surface. Just remove with a grinding machine as much that the brown is not entirely gone. Yes, only on the side the Ouija Board should be builded. |
| `Paint Job` | Use the paint and let it dry completely before you proceed. |
| `Shabby Chick` | Use grinding paper to create a used, shabby look. |
| `Print Job` | Slice and print the STL files in your favourite colour. The STL files are build for the Ender-3 Pro bed which is 220x220. The hight is 0.5 centimetre. |
| `Glue Job` | Glue the signs, letters and numbers to the board. Use a sketch before to align it just you want to have it. |
| `Build frame` | For casting we need to create a frame high enough to hold the resin in place. The project uses gaffer tape and a tension belt. Recommendations is to use a thin metal around and after that the tension belt which gives you better results speaking of the edges. Less grinding and straight look. The solution with the tape has its own problems. The tape tends to bends to the inside so you don't get nice resin edges. |
| `Casting 1st layer` | Mix the resin and the hardener according to the producers recommendations. Put some glitter in it if you want. We used three of a quarter of the small packages. Glitter colour silver and blue. Keep the rest for the 2nd layer. |
| `Bubble Theorem` | Hardening starts after an hour for our resin.   Weather conditions: Around 20° Celsius and more or less sunlight (slightly cloudy). You need to remove dirt (outside, wind, you know) with pliers. For the air bubbles we used a Crème brûlée bunsen burner and only a short burst! <1 second. You harden the surface with the heat. Maybe replace the burner with a heat gun. But if the surface is hard no bubbles can reach the surface anymore and you cannot do anything anymore here. The rest is post process! Don't try to use any tools since you will make it even worse.  |
| `Casting 2nd layer` | Mix the resin and hardener with the rest of the glitter and pour it slowly over the the surface. |
| `Bubble Theorem` | Repeat the removing bubbles like described two steps before. |
| `Drying` | Let the resin dry. Be sure that it has constantly over 20° Celsius and the humidity is not more than 80%. Yes that takes time, at least two days. |
| `Grinding` | You need to grind the frame around and the resin as well. tbd. |
